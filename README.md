# Angular Portfolio

This project was built using the most recent iteration of Angular and the [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli). Functional releases of this app are deployed via branch to be hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Purpose

- The original goal was to create a personal portfolio using a modular, scalable framework that could integrate with the GitHub API to provide a more detailed front-end experience. 

- My initial experiment used a framework called "Pure-MVC" https://github.com/atangeman/portfolio-puremvc. Development was discontinued due to framework limitations. 

- My second attempt utilized AngularJS: https://github.com/atangeman/portfolio-angularjs. Although I enjoyed the AngularJs environment, the ability to properly handle event delivery using the service / controller pattern.

- This current attempt is by far the most successful. The funcitonal prototype is easily scalable and intuitive. In addition, the implementation of Typescript offered a more familiar strongly-typed element that helped me progress a bit faster.
